# Quiz 2 Learning Notes

### Function Composition
- `funcName xs = f1(f2 xs)` can be rewritten as `funcName = f1 . f2`. 
- safer since we are not handling variables.

### Implicit Argument Passing
```hs
positive :: Int -> Bool

--non implicit
positive x = x>=0

--on the fly constructed function
positive x = (>=0) x

--implicit
positive = (>=0)
```

### Data Constructors
```hs
data Nat = Zero
			| Succ Nat
```
- here, natural numnber `two` can be represented as `Succ(Succ Zero)`. 
- List type can be remade like this, too, wherein
```hs
data List = Empty
			| Cons Type List
```
- here, this creates a linked list (on the heap). When initialized like `xs = Cons 1 (Cons 2 Empty)`, we see a linked list in the format `Cons 1 --> Cons 2 --> Empty`

#### Avoiding Sharing
- Some definitions, like
```hs
data List = Empty
			| Cons Nat List

one = Succ Zero
two = Succ one
ys = Cons one (Cons two Emty)
```
- we have `one` referenced by (~pointed to by) both `two` and `ys`, as `two` is `Succ one`
- can be fixed by replacing `two = Succ one` with `two = Succ (Succ Zero)`
- sharing increases efficiency slightly, but makes garbage collection a bit harder.

#### Cyclic Data Structures
- when a constructor points to itself, or a previous constructor. Some examples
```hs
data List = Empty
			| Cons Int List

ones = Cons 1 ones -- points to itself
morse = Cons 1 (Cons 0 morse) -- points to Cons 1 (...)

zeros = Cons 0 zeros -- that's a lot of 0's
big = Cons 1 zeros -- one then alot of 0's
```

### Ignoring Errors
```hs
head [] --ERROR

ignore :: a -> String
ignore x = "Nope"

ignore(head []) -- "Nope"
```
- in haskell, you pass the whole expression into ignore, which is not evaluated as it is not needed. Therefore, the error creating function is not evaluated.

### Type Derivations
```hs
data Grade = A | B | C | D | F
			deriving Eq ...

instance Show Grade where
	show A = "1.0" 
	...
```
- This will not be on quizzes or tests

### Grammar
- Grammar is given by a set of rules / productions
- production looks like `A ::= B C`, where A makes up the `LHS`, B and C make up the `RHS`, and A, B and C are all symbols, or strings.
- example grammar
```
sentence ::= noun verb noun		(R1)
noun     ::= dogs				(R2)
noun     ::= teeth				(R3)
verb     ::= have				(R4)
```
- `sentence`, `noun`, `verb` above are nonterminal symbols, as they can be replaced by their RHS.
- `dogs`, `have`, `teeth` are terminal symbols, as they cannot be expanded further.
- we can derive sentences from nonterminal symbols, through repeated substitution.  
- empty rules are epsilon rules. They are represented like `bin ::= Ð„`
- derivation is the process of producing a sentence in accordance with the rules of the grammar.

#### Context Free Grammar
- grammar where LHS contains only one symbol.
- each iteration of LHS is replaced by RHS no matter context

### Syntax Tree
- all leaves are terminal symbols
- all internal nodes are nonterminal symbols
- nonterminal in the tree root indicates the type
- derivation order is not captured in the tree, as we do not care abou the derivation process. All we care about is that the final output is a valid grammar.
- can also replace internal nodes with rulenames

### Abstract vs Concrete Syntax
- concrete syntax is the set of all sentences or strings that can be developed from a grammar. 
- abstract view is the set of all syntax trees that a grammar can produce

### Abstract Syntax
- some syntax trees can be reduced, by removing redundant rules, for example a rule where there is only one possible expansion that has start and end that are in the graph, the intermediate node with rule Rn does not need to be present
- can be represented linearly, in text, where:
```
sentence ::= noun verb noun			(R1)
			| sentence and sentence (R2)
noun     ::= dogs | teeth			(R3, R4)
verb     ::= have					(R5)

Tree:
		R1
	   / | \
	 R3 R5 R4
	/    |   \
  dogs have teeth

Simplified Tree
		R1
	 /   |   \
  dogs have teeth

Linearly
R1 dogs have teeth

More complex (different sentence)
R2(R1 dogs have teeth)
  (R1 dogs have dogs)
```

#### Abstract Syntax and Haskell
- abstract syntax allows us to do do a bunch of interesting stuff, using hashell as a meta language.
- Translation steps:
	- for each nonterminal, define a data type
	- for each rule, define a constructor
- Haskell type names must be capitalized.
- above example is converted as follows
```hs
--sentence ::= noun verb noun			(R1)
--			| sentence and sentence (R2)
--noun     ::= dogs | teeth			(R3, R4)
--verb     ::= have					(R5)

data Sentence = Cons1 Noun Verb Noun | Cons2 Sentence Sentence
data Noun = Dogs | Teeth
data Verb = Have

--to create tree
--		R1
--	 /   |   \
--dogs have teeth

Cons1 Dogs Have Teeth

--to create and sentence like
--R2(R1 dogs have teeth)
--  (R1 dogs have dogs)

Cons2 (Cons 1 Dogs Have Teeth) (Cons1 Dogs Have Dogs)
```
- `Cons1`, `Cons2` are constructors for nonterminals. They can be called `Phrase` and `And`, `R1` and `R2`, ...
